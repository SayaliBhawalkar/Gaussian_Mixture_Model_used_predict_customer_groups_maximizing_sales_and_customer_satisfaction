Problem Statement

As a retail business owner, you want to understand and categorize
your customers into distinct segment based on their purchasing behaviour
This segmentation will help you marketing strategies and
promotions to difference customer groups, ultimately maximizing sales
and customers satisfaction

To achieve this, you plan to use the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), a probabilistic 
clustering approach that assumes customer data is generated from multiple Gaussian 
distributions. Unlike traditional clustering methods such as K-means, GMM provides 
a more flexible and probabilistic way to model complex customer behaviors, allowing 
for overlapping segments.

By applying GMM to customer data—such as purchase frequency, average spending, product 
preferences, and shopping habits—you can identify meaningful customer segments. This 
will enable you to:

i)Personalize marketing campaigns for high-value and low-engagement customers.

ii)Optimize promotions and discounts to target specific segments effectively.

iii)Improve customer retention strategies by understanding shifting behavior patterns.

iv)Enhance product recommendations based on segment preferences.

Ultimately, using GMM-based customer segmentation will help drive better business decisions, 
improve marketing ROI, and create a more personalized shopping experience, leading to higher \
customer satisfaction and long-term profitability.
